## MARVELous!
This is a simple chat app that allows people to discuss/debate which of two random characters (pulled from the Marvel universe) would win in a 1 vs 1 fight! The users will then be able to choose their favorite in that circumstance.

## Motivation
This app is meant for Stan Lee-inites who want to chat with other Marvel enthusiasts and watch their favorite Marvel characters go head-to-head.
